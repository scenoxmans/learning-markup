Oh grid...Writing this note brings back so many memories. Grid was so hard to understand. And every youtube video would explain it differently. Now looking back after making this exercise and many others i can tell you that grid is one of the best tools that css provides us with.
For this exercise i had to make a chessboard with all chesspieces on it.
